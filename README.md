## Python Installation

 - Step 1: Select Version of Python to Install Python has various versions available with differences between the syntax and working of different versions of the language.
   We need to choose the version which we want to use or need. There are different versions of Python 2 and Python 3 available. I used the python 3 (v3.10.5).

 - Step 2:  Download Python Executable Installer
On the web browser, in the official site of python (www.python.org), move to the Download for Windows section.
    All the available versions of Python will be listed. Select the version required by you and click on Download. Let suppose, we chose the Python 3.10.5 version.
    On clicking download, various available executable installers shall be visible with different operating system specifications. Choose the installer which suits your system operating system and download the instlaller. Let suppose, we select the Windows installer(64 bits).
    The download size is less than 30MB.

 - Step 3:  Run Executable Installer
We downloaded the Python 3.9.1 Windows 64 bit installer.
    Run the installer. Make sure to select both the checkboxes at the bottom and then click Install New.
    On clicking the Install Now, The installation process starts.
    The installation process will take few minutes to complete and once the installation is successful, the following screen is displayed.

 - Step 4:  Verify Python is installed on Windows
    To ensure if Python is succesfully installed on your system. Follow the given steps −

```bash
  Open the command prompt.

  Type ‘python’ and press enter.
```
  The version of the python which you have installed will be displayed if the python is successfully installed on your windows.


 - Step 5 :  Verify Pip was installed
Pip is a powerful package management system for Python software packages. Thus, make sure that you have it installed.

To verify if pip was installed, follow the given steps:
  ```bash
  Open the command prompt.

Enter "pip –V" to check if pip was installed.
```
 - The following output appears if pip is installed successfully.

## Visual Studio Code Installation

 - Step 1 :
Download VS code from here https://code.visualstudio.com/download .

 - Step 2 :
Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows. 
Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). Then, run the file – it will only take a minute.
Accept the agreement and click “next.”
After accepting all the requests press finish button. By default, VS Code installs under: "C:\users{username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code."

## Install Selenium

 - For installing selenium for python you need to do this:
 ```bash
  open cmd from windows search bar
  type in:  pip install selenium   , after that press enter
```


## Chrome with selenium

 - Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. 
Chrome, for example, requires chrome_driver.exe, which needs to be installed before to use it.  
You can find it here: 

https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=96.0.4664.18/
##  Install Portaudio

 - For that you need to acces Python extension packages("https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/") and then:
    search for Pyaudio.

 - Download the version that corresponds with the version of python you have.

 ```bash
  open cmd
  type in: pip install + the name of Pyaudio file that you downloaded
```

## Install library for video rec

 ```bash
  open cmd and type in:
  pip3 install numpy opencv-python pyautogui

```

## Install library for computing decibels

```bash
  open cmd and type in
  pip install scipy
```
## Install socket( for checking internet connection)

 ```bash
  open cmd and type in 
  pip install sockets

```

 - *Sidenote*
If you try to run this code that I made with VSCode you need to run and debug at the same time, othewise your files are gonna go in a pycache folder under the format ".pyc".
